# Go4

This is a simple script that uses the OpenAI API to interact with the GPT-3 model. It prompts the user for input, sends it to the GPT-3 model, and prints the model's response.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/joeBlockchain/Go4.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd Go4`
3. Install the necessary Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the script: `python Go4.py`

When you run the script, it will prompt you for your OpenAI API key. Please enter it when prompted. The API key will be stored locally and used for future requests to the OpenAI API.
